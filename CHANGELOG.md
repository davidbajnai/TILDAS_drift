# version R1  - first revision after initial release

* General improvements to the codebase
* Updated [Figure 3](figures/LT_Figure_3.png) showing the concentration dependence of ∆'<sup>17</sup>O to include new data from the Göttingen lab measured in 2025
* Added [Figure 3b](figures/LT_Figure_3b.png) as a supplementary plot showing the concentration dependence of δ<sup>18</sup>O
* Removed two measurements from the Göttingen dataset ([Table S1](data/LT_Table_S1.csv)) due to sample name mix-up and analytical issues
